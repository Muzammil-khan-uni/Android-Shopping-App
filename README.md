# Simple Shopping Cart App (E-Commerce Demo)

This is an Android-based shopping application where users can view a list of products, see product details, add items to their cart, view and manage their cart, and finally simulate a checkout process. The project demonstrates object-oriented principles, data passing between activities, and adapter-based UI population.
